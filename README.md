# Prefix
The default prefix for Earth-chan is `plana `. Though, in the near future, it can be changed.

# Usage
Usage is a template for how a command can be used. It is made up of [Aliases](https://github.com/TacticalTechJay/bookish-waffle#Aliases) and [Arguments](https://github.com/TacticalTechJay/bookish-waffle#Arguments).

## Aliases
Command aliases, It's exactly what it sounds like. Multiple names for one command that you can use to trigger the same command with different names that will produce the same result. They're wrapped in `《 》` and separated by |, like this: `《info|what|details》`. This means in a guild where the prefix is t. that command can be triggered as `plana info`, `plana what` or `plana details`.

## Arguments
Arguments are the additional pieces of information you provide, to get the information you are looking for. Arguments are separated into 2 categories, required and optional. Required arguments are wrapped in `< >`. Optional arguments are wrapped in `[ ]`. Arguments follow the following format `Name:Type{Min,Max}`.

Example: `<Points:int{1,50}> [Level:int{1,120}]`
- Points is a required argument: it is expecting an integer type with a minimum value of 1 and maximum of 50.
- Level is an optional argument: it is expecting an integer type with a minimum value of 1 and maximum of 120.
